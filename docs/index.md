# design.VA.gov

## 📖 Overview
Provides common design standards to designers and developers; includes several developer specific resources, 
including a component library, predesigned templates (e.g., for emails) and a CSS library[^1]

## 🚪 Onboarding process 
Entirely self service: the CSS library can be installed via `NPM` and the web component library can be installed via `yarn`.
Active developers on the VA.gov platform are able to submit contributions to the design system via pull requests.
